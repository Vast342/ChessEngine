# Clarity

The C++ rewrite is complete! Clarity is now faster and better, using new techniques, and I have learned a new language!

For those who didn't see the engine in its depressing, confusing, error-filled C# state, this engine was originally written in C# before I decided to switch to C++. That decision was one of the greatest I think I've ever had, as the engine is now faster, easier to read, less error-filled(hopefully), and better overall.

My current Estimate of elo (calculated by playing large sums of games against engines with known CCRL ratings) is 2050.

#### Warning: Clarity currently uses pext for move generation, which means that CPUs without BMI2 or CPUs with a slow implementation (Zen 2 or earlier) will not be able to use it, A replacement (magic bitboards) is underway.
