> Relatively strong UCI chess engine

## Feature List:

CLI:
  1. Functional (but not complete) UCI implementation
  2. printstate: shows the state of the board.
  3. perftsuite <suite>: performs a suite of perft tests, currently only supports the suite ethereal.
  4. perft <depth>: performs a perft test from the current position and outputs the result.
  5. splitperft <depth>: performs a perft test from the current position and outputs the result seperated by which move is the first one done.
  6. getfen: outputs a string of Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) that encodes the current position.
  7. incheck: outputs if the current position is in check or not.
  8. evaluate: outputs the evaluation of the current position.
  9. bench <depth>: performs the bench test, a fixed depth search on a series of 50 positions.

Board Representation:
  1. Copymake moves
  2. Board represented using 8 bitboards
  3. Pext bitboards, lookups, and setwise move generation
  4. Repetition detection
  5. Incremental Zobrist hashing
  6. Incremental NNUE Updates

Search: 
  1. PVS search
  2. Aspiration windows
  3. Transposition Table(TT) cutoffs
  4. Reverse Futility Pruning
  5. Null Move Pruning
  6. Late Move Reductions (log function, generated on startup)
  7. Fail-soft

Evaluation:
  1. NNUE trained from self play

Move ordering:
  1. TT best move
  2. MVV-LVA
  3. Killer Move Heuristic
  4. History Heuristic
