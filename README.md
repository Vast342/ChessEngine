# Clarity

The C++ rewrite is complete! Clarity is now faster and better, using new techniques, and I have learned a new language!

For those who didn't see the engine in its depressing, confusing, error-filled C# state, this engine was originally written in C# before I decided to switch to C++. That decision was one of the greatest I think I've ever had, as the engine is now faster, easier to read, less error-filled(hopefully), and better overall.

My current Estimate of elo (calculated by playing large sums of games against engines with known CCRL ratings) is 2250.

### Todo lists:

General Things:
  1. Web version of the engine
  2. or unleash it on lichess

Board Representation:
  1. General performancey things

### Divided by release:

#### Clarity V2.0.0 Plans:
  3. SEE for move ordering, pruning, etc
  4. try again with LMP

#### Clarity V3.0.0 Plans:
  1. nnue
  
#### Clarity V4.0.0 Plans:
  1. Conthist
  2. actual futility pruning (not reverse)
  3. Razoring
  4. Delta pruning in qsearch
  5. Syzgyzy tablebase support (oh no not the 3000 uncommented lines)
  6. history pruning
  7. mate distance pruning
  8. capture history heuristic?
  9. singular extensions (huh)
  10. multicut(huh)



## Feature List:

CLI:
  1. UCI Implementation
  2. printstate: shows the state of the board.
  3. perftsuite <suite>: performs a suite of perft tests, currently only supports the suite ethereal.
  4. perft <depth>: performs a perft test from the current position and outputs the result.
  5. splitperft <depth>: performs a perft test from the current position and outputs the result seperated by which move is the first one done.
  6: getfen: outputs a string of Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) that encodes the current position.
  7: incheck: outputs if the current position is in check or not.
  8: evaluate: outputs the evaluation of the current position.
  9: bench <depth>: performs the bench test, a fixed depth search on a series of 50 positions.

Board Representation:
  1. Copymake moves
  2. Board represented using 8 bitboards
  3. Pext bitboards, lookups, and setwise move generation
  4. Repetition detection
  5. Incremental Zobrist hashing
  6. Incremental PSQT updates

Search: 
  1. PVS search
  2. Aspiration windows
  3. Transposition Table(TT) cutoffs
  4. Reverse Futility Pruning
  5. Null Move Pruning
  6. Late Move Reductions (log function, generated on startup)
  7. Fail-soft
  8. Currently nonfunctional LMP

Evaluation:
  1. PeSTO PSQTs and piece weights (soon to be tuned)
  2. Non-functional passed pawn detection

Move ordering:
  1. TT best move
  2. MVV-LVA
  3. History Heuristic
